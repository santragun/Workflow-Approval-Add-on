# Workflow-Approval-Add-on

The Google form workflow approval add-on is a Google forms add-on that was created using Google apps script. It automates the approval process in a hierarchical structure. After the form is configured with this add-on, managers or authorities who have the authority to approve or deny requests will receive requests by email as soon as respondents submit their response. They can then use the Workflow approval web app dashboard to approve, reject, or alter requests.
